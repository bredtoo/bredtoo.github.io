            <h2>I made a decision on a whim, and I dont regret it.</h2>
            <p>
                When I graduated high school, I actually thought I was going to study something in the film industry or
                environmental field.
                I had always loved editing and content creation and wanted to take my already developing skills to the next
                level. So, when I took my gap year, I started making short-form content and streaming. Over time, I realized
                that, yes, I do love content creation and interacting with viewers, but my love for editing drifted away as
                the work got more complicated.
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                So, I started looking for other study opportunities, but there was one problem: I wasn't really interested
                in anything. I looked at my grades from high school. 6.5 in biology — meh. 7 in science — no thanks. 8.5 in
                computer science — oh yeah!
                I was good at computer science, but I never really liked the subject. What pushed me to start applying was
                actually my friend taking this exact program at HZ University. He said he really enjoyed it, so I attended
                the open day and was thoroughly impressed! I loved the building, and the presentation was well done. I checked 
                other colleges too, but none of them amounted to HZ for me personally. They usually specified in one single path
                like datascience, programming or AI specialist, but I didn't know what I wanted to do yet. So when i heard that HZ
                taught everything and gives the opportunity to specialize later on I knew this was the school for me. The biggest
                benefits for me were,
            </p>
                <ul class="blog-list">
                    <li>Travel isn't far.</li>
                    <li>Loved the building and first impressions.</li>
                    <li>I get to study something i'm decently good at.</li>
                    <li>One of my friends is going there anyways.</li>
                    <li>I get to explore the broader side of IT.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                So I gave it a shot, and it's been really fun so far! We had to make a portfolio in just two weeks. It didn't
                have to be completely finished or look perfect at all, but I took it as a challenge and started working
                relentlessly on my project. I made a ton of mistakes, and not everything worked out the way I wanted it to,
                but the process was incredibly fun.
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                I really discovered a passion for front-end development and I am constantly learning more!
