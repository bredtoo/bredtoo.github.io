            <h2>My strengths and weaknesses</h2>
            <p>
                So a quick rundown for people who don't know what SWOT really is. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses,
                Opportunities and Threats. It's a tool that helps you take a step back and see what you're really all about.
                What are your strengths, what could use some work, what opportunities can you grab, and what challenges
                might be coming your way? You answer all these questions so that you can make smarter choices and build some self
                confidence.
                <span class="spacer"></span>
            </p>
            <h3>Let's start with my strengths.</h3>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Solo work - I work well solo.</li>
                <li>Pressure - I work decently well in high pressure situations like tests and exams.</li>
                <li>Listening - I pay close attention to what people have to say.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I work the most comfortably alone. It's not that I don't like people, but when I have a clear vision,
                I just want things done my way.
                <span class="minispacer"></span>
                I work faster once I get the hang of things, and I am generally just more focused when I'm alone. I also
                don't like the expectations people set when you're in a group setting. I wouldn't say I work terribly in a
                group; I just work way more comfortably solo!
                <span class="minispacer"></span>
                I have also developed the wonderful ability to work well under pressure. Where other people freeze up or
                crack, I often thrive and perform better under a decent amount of pressure. No one likes being under
                pressure, but being able to work under it is a gift I have!
                <span class="minispacer"></span>
                Now, it might surprise you how many people are just terrible listeners. I always pay attention to what
                people teach me or have to say. I take a lot of notes during lectures so I know exactly what to expect and,
                more importantly, what to do. I take feedback very seriously and will always try to implement it in whatever
                way I can.
                <span class="spacer"></span>
            </p>
            <h3>to my weaknesses!</h3>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Attendance - I have a bad history with attendance.</li>
                <li>Slow learner - It takes a bit more time for me to understand things fully.</li>
                <li>Time managment - I am terrible at planning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My attendance has always been bad. I get so demotivated in the mornings to the point where I couldn't get
                out of bed. This is not just a laziness issue; I was dealing with some mental health challenges during that
                time as well. I hope that issue will not carry over to college, but the weakness is still there.
                <span class="minispacer"></span>
                Another weakness I have is that I learn relatively slowly. I like to take my time with the work that I do. I
                am usually the last person done with their work in a classroom. I just really like to make sure I fully
                understand what I'm doing.
                <span class="minispacer"></span>
                Now, my worst weakness is definitely time management. I managed to graduate high school by studying only one
                day in advance for all my testsâ€”not the smartest idea. I think if I had implemented proper planning, high
                school would've been much easier.
                <span class="spacer"></span>
            </p>
            <h3>What are my opportunities?</h3>

            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>A job - Multiple well paying jobs in the ICT sector.</li>
                <li>Meet new people - International class means a lot of new people!</li>
                <li>Building my portfolio - Getting knowledge in the ICT sector.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Of course, when looking at opportunities, one of the biggest is the availability of future work. With the
                growing demand in the ICT sector and the increasing number of people who avoid this field because they think
                AI will make jobs "not future-proof" (sorry for the rant), it's a great opportunity to pursue. HZ also
                offers internships and ensures you start building connections with companies so you can begin working as
                soon as you graduate!
                <span class="minispacer"></span>
                HZ offers the option to study in an international class! I love this choice because I enjoy meeting new
                people and getting to know them. That sadly doesn't mean I'm naturally good at it, though. But it's really
                fun hearing everyone's stories about where they're from, why they chose this subject, and why this location,
                etc. I've already met some really wonderful people and have been enjoying my class a lot!
                <span class="minispacer"></span>
                I didn't expect us to build a portfolio in the first couple of weeks of the program, but I was so glad we
                did! I had always wanted to make a portfolio but never really felt motivated enough. So, when we were tasked
                with creating a portfolio website, I was stoked! I really enjoyed building the website and hope I can keep
                developing it and adding more content!
                <span class="spacer"></span>
            </p>
            <h3>And at last, what are my threats?</h3>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Burnout - 40+ hours a week of studying</li>
                <li>Automation - Rapid development of AI</li>
                <li>Market saturation - Sectors are getting highly crowded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Burnout is a terrible feeling that no one likes to experience. Sadly, it is also a very common experience
                for people who work full time. Work continues to pile up, sleep keeps getting shorter and shorter, and
                before you know it, you just can't keep going. I'm scared that I will get overwhelmed with the amount of new
                knowledge I am expected to understand. But a good balance of work and free time should be prioritized in
                order to prevent it!
                <span class="minispacer"></span>
                Even though I called the people who believe the whole ICT sector will get automated by AI silly, some
                sectors really are being automated. These sectors usually involve repetitive tasks, but it's still something
                to keep in mind. Maybe I'll find something that I really enjoy doing, only to discover that it got
                automated. The main thing to take away from this is that people will always be needed in the ICT sector, but
                some jobs can be taken over by AI.
                <span class="minispacer"></span>
                Another thing that worries me is the amount of market saturation in the ICT sector. With so many people
                entering the field, competition for jobs and internships is getting tougher and tougher. On top of that, a
                lot of companies outsource work to cheaper labor markets, which makes it even harder to stand out. It's a
                little intimidating, and it means I really need to keep improving my skills and finding ways to separate
                myself from the crowd.
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                And that's my whole SWOT analysis! Thank you for reading!
