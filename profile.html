                    <p> Hello! A little bit about myself, my name is Joshua, I am 19 years old. I am half dutch half
                        indonesian. I was born and raised
                        in the Netherlands so I sadly don't speak Indonesian. I live at home with my parents and sister.
                        I also have a dog, his name is dooby. Here are some characteristics about me:

                            <li>Black hair (or very dark brown)</li>
                            <li>Very VERY tall (175cm...)</li>
                            <li>Wears a cheap watch and a ring.</li>
                            <li>Asian looking (i guess..?)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With this information you're sure to spot me in the crowd!</p>

                    <p>
                        I'm currently studying ICT at HZ in Middelburg and have been really
                        enjoying it so far.
                        I like the short lectures, because then I can figure stuff out by myself. I think it's the most
                        fun way to learn stuff!
                        Middelburg is not far away from where I live, but despite that fact I don't
                        know the city at all. If you wish to see more on
                        why I chose to study ICT, please check out the blog page! If you just want my <a

                    <h1>Boyfriend!</h1>
                    <p> Besides being a student I'm also a boyfriend! It's a hard job to do but I manage... I hope she
                        doesn't read this.
                        Jokes aside, I love my girlfriend! Her name is Sweetie and she's the love of my life. This is a
                        stupid and embarrassing story but we actually met over
                        a video game. We became good friends and after a while, I visited her and since then
                        we started dating. We've been dating for 2 years now!
                        She's British / Filipino and lives in the UK which means we don't really get to see eachother
                        that often, but despite that we've maintained a strong healthy relationship for the past 2
                        years! (she's the one who made all the frog doodles too!)

                    <h1>Gamer!</h1>
                    <p> I am a gamer! I've been gaming my entire life. I started gaming on my Ipad when I was around 5
                        years old. I started off with
                        minecraft PE and ever since then my love for gaming has grown. My favorite story game has to be
                        Ghost of Tsushima. Everything in that game
                        is just top notch. Mechanics, story, graphics ðŸ¤Œ. But I don't really play a lot of story games.
                        Instead I like first person shooters.
                        The game I play the most is Valorant at the moment. I am a prx fanboy and a washed plat player
                        and a duelist
                        main. If you have the misfortune of q'ing with
                        me then be prepared to lose RR. Here are some hot takes:

                            <li>Aspas is still the goat of Valorant, not Chronicle</li>
                            <li>PRX trumps pacific and it isn't even close</li>
                            <li>Nats is the best sentinel in the entire game</li>
                            <li>Sentinels (the team) is trash</li>

                    <h1>Lifter!</h1>
                    <p> Despite not looking like it, I am (was) an avid gym goer! I had a 4 day on one day off
                        bro-split. I know that isn't the most optimal
                        for building muscle, but it was the most fun for me. I like taking the more science-based
                        approach to working out, but I don't necessarily
                        believe it's the superior choice or anything so don't flame me. The gym I go to is the
                        basic-fit. It's a very popular gym chain here in The Netherlands and they
                        even have a location here in Middelburg! I love working out with my friends and sometimes even
                        my mom or sister! My favorite muscle to hit
                        generally changes, but I like legs! My favorite exercise is definitely the deadlift. I just love
                        the technicality of it. Also the risk of folding
                        like a piece of paper is also fun.
                        I took a long break from working out, but I wish to be back as soon as I get the time to again!
                        And yes I will change my split.
