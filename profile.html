                    <h1>Student!</h1>
                    <p> I am currently a student at HZ in Middelburg. I'm currently studying ICT and have been really
                        enjoying it so far.
                        I like the short lectures, because then I can figure stuff out by myself. I think it's the most
                        fun way to learn stuff!
                        Middelburg is only a 15 min. trainride away from where I live, but despite that fact I don't
                        know the city at all. If you wish to see more on
                        why I chose to study ICT, please check out the blog page!</p>
