        <h2>"Spaghetti but it's worth it"</h2>
        <p>
            On the day where we had to present our posters I not only got feedback from my fellow classmates, but also 2 
            fourth-year students. They were really funny and gave me some really good feedback that I implemented in my
            site immediately.

            When the day came where we had to present our posters, I was a bit nervous. That morning I really quickly made a poster and headed off to school.
            When I arrived at school my buddy Daniel said that he didn't have time to make a poster. So I offered to make him a poster at school with 15 minutes left.
            So it was a close call, but I managed! The poster wasn't pretty but at least we had fun figuring out how the printers work over here. After that I helped some
            other students print their posters out as well.
            <span class="minispacer"></span>
            When we were finally sat down and started giving each other feedback, a fourth year student offered to give us some feedback. We gladly accepted. She was really 
            funny and gave really honest feedback. She loved my front-end development and said that the style was amazing and even said that once I know about "The Board" 
            I should look her up immediately. The main feedback she playfully ripped me apart on was my CSS file. It had over 900 lines of code. Since it was my first 
            website I did not know that was an abnormal thing. I did see it coming though. She was so blown away by the style of my website that she kept saying: "Your code 
            is absolute spaghetti in the back, but it's worth it" which made me laugh. She recommended that I make a CSS file for each HTML page I made. I'd still say
            they're a bit big, but at least they're a lot more organised now! Then she got another 4th year student to come and give me feedback because she was that impressed
            with my work. He basically gave the same feedback which was the gigantic style.css file and also gave me tips on how to improve the readability on my site. They were 
            both really nice and I really value the feedback that they gave me.
            <span class="minispacer"></span>
            At the end of the day our posters got ranked and I got 4th! Just shy of getting a prize. Oh well, better luck next time!
