                Now because I have to write one blog about the ICT line of work I will give some info I learnt about the 2
                jobs that look most interesting to me once I graduate.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Science</h3>
            <p>
                Let's start off with Data Science. Data scientists are basically detectives for data. They dig through
                mountains of information to find patterns, trends, and insights that can help companies make smarter
                decisions. What really excites me about this role is how versatile it is. You can work in almost any
                industry, from healthcare to gaming to finance, and every day brings a new challenge. I also love the mix of
                technical skills and creativity required. You need to know how to code, understand statistics, and at the
                same time, think critically about what the data is really telling you. It feels like a job where you're
                constantly learning, experimenting, and solving puzzles, and that's exactly the kind of work I'm drawn to.
            </p>

            <h3>AI Specialist</h3>
            <p>
                Now, looking at the AI specialist role, it feels like stepping into the future. AI specialists design
                systems that can learn, adapt, and make machines that can essentially think in some ways. What
                draws me to this job is the creativity and innovation involved. You're not just analyzing existing
                data, you're building tools that can predict outcomes, automate tasks, or even interact with people in
                intelligent ways. It's challenging, for sure, because you need strong programming skills, a solid
                understanding of algorithms, and the ability to solve problems that don't have clear-cut answers. But that's
                also what makes it exciting: every project feels like a new frontier, and there's so much potential to make
                an impact on the way we live and work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Which one I will pick is still up for grabs, but maybe in a couple of years I can make a decision!
